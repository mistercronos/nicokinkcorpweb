        <p>NicoKink Corp was founded by two young 6th grade students called
        Nicolas Kress, Nicolas Thollot, and Thibault Eid. Later, Clyde Sheridan and Liam Christie joined them. During this year, they discovered HTML and were able to create a website using Cloud9 and their imagination.
        they used their website to present their games made with python.
        They also thank their IT teacher Mr. James for giving them the love and oppurtunity to code</p>
